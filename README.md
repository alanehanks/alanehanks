- 👋 Hi, I’m @alanehanks
- 👀 I’m interested in data in general. I've worked as a data analyst, data architect, and data management consultant.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more technical skills related to data including ETL, data pipelines and data engineering, as well as programming and query languages. (Python and SQL, specifically)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things mentioned above.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm the best worst golfer
